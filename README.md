McGill-Robotics-AUV-Control-System
==================================

Excerpts from the controls package, as taken from the larger private McGill Robotics competition repository

In 2013-2014, I led the McGill Robotics engineering design team, building an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) for the AUVSI and ONR's 17th International RoboSub Competition.

I built the control system with C++ and ROS, integrating with the computer vision, state estimation, autonomous planner, front-end, and simulations sections. The controls package will not work in isolation from the larger system, but this code is included in my portfolio to showcase my programming experience.
